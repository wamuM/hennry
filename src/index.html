                <p><u>Xth Day at the farm.</u><br><br>
                I haven't seen anyone since I left New <bold>Yolk</bold> City. 
                I have started to talk to the chickens to feel less lonely. 
                There is this beautiful white one I've grown fond of, <input id="name" type="text" placeholder="[insert name]"/> I call her, 
                with fethers softer than silk, and her crimson red crest. 
                I couldn't belive my eyes, she was defending her eggs from a volie of evil hens. 
                She is so beautiful and graceful fighting those evil doers. 
                Her mesmerizing movements look like a dance.
